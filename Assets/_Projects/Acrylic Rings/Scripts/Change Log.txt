- renamed ManipulateNailBlob.MoveVertices() to ManipulateNailBlob.ManipulatePoints()

- added public IEnumerator StartFlow()

- added public float CalculatePercantage()

- fixed MovePoints function, it now calculates the relative distance from the end point, 
so when the player moves the points they all are moved by the same amount and not relative to the distance of their end positions

- added private IEnumerator AfterTouch(), to make the blob flow after touch, as well as updated to the StartManipulate(), Manipulate() & EndManipulate()
